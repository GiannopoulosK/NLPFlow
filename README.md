NLPFlow is a Python library designed to simplify the complexity of building and deploying natural language processing (NLP) applications. It leverages well-established tools like `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`, and `optuna` for text preprocessing and model development. NLPFlow provides a powerful toolkit for automating NLP workflows, making it easier for data scientists and developers to build models efficiently.

## Features

Currently, it is in early-stage development, but already offers:

- Full text preprocessing pipeline with optional preprocessing steps.
- Development of Naive Bayes models with hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization.

Planned features:

- Tuning based on metrics other than simple accuracy
- Sentiment analysis with pretrained models.
- Named Entity Recognition using `spaCy`, with added functionality.
- Support for additional model types with hyperparameter tuning.
- Integration with popular tools like MLFlow, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

## Installation

You can install NLPFlow using pip:

```bash
pip install nlpflow
```

## Documentation
Documentation is still under development. You can check the [examples.ipynb](https://github.com/GiannopoulosK/NLPFlow/blob/main/examples.ipynb) file for example usage of the library.
